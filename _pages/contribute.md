## Submitting or editing design principles in the collection

If you wish to submit a new example or edit an existing example there are two ways.

1. [Submit an example or suggested edit **via a short form**](https://zursayc0713.typeform.com/to/DTkTul82)
2. [Submit an example or make an edit **via pull request on GitHub**](https://github.com/benbrignell/principles.design#contributing). 
  * **Submissions:** [Follow the guidelines to submitting a new example](https://github.com/benbrignell/principles.design#contributing)
  * **Edits:** You can make an edit via the GitHub link on a design principles examples page.

### Guidelines

Submissions need to contain the following:

* A set of **original Design Principles**
* A **source article** or **blog post** listing a set of design principles in more detail. Along with the principles themselves, a source article would contain something about how you or your team came up with these principles. Consider a few of the following questions:

  - How did you decide on what your design principles should be?
  - What you did you learn?
  - What worked, what didnâ€™t work?
  - How do you follow these principles?
  - Have these principles made your process better?
  - If so, how?

You don't need to cover all these things in detail. Overall we want to know the **story behind how you created your principles**.

Here are some great examples of those that do this:

* [Airbnb](https://airbnb.design/the-way-we-build/)
* [Government Design Principles](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-design-principles)
* [Josh Clark's "Design in the Era of the Algorithm"](https://bigmedium.com/speaking/design-in-the-era-of-the-algorithm.html)

You can submit examples from other individuals, companies or teams that you think would be useful to the community.
