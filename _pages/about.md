## [principles.design](https://principles.design) is a place to learn about and create Design Principles

This [open source project](https://github.com/benbrignell/principles.design) is managed by [Ben Brignell](https://benbrignell.com), an independent product designer and consultant from the U.K.

Ben has always been interested in design principles and how they can assist when making decisions. He has helped organisations develop their principles and [conducts workshops](/workshops-and-advice) enabling product teams to build the capabilities to do so in-house. 

The project, launched in December 2017, has won awards and attracted millions of visitors. It serves as a valuable resource for user experience designers, product designers, organisations, schools and universities worldwide helping people understand design principles and their application in design, technology, architecture and infrastructure.

If you have found an example or have developed your own principles and they are available to the public then please add them to the [collection](/contribute).
