principles:
- principle: Consistency
  summary: Embrace patterns and recognize that our usability is greatly improved when similar parts are expressed in similar ways. Interfaces that are consistent are more predictable, which means that they are easier to learn. Learnable interfaces feel more usable since less friction is involved.
- principle: Functional
  summary: Our products are meant for intensive daily use, providing value efficiently. This is why our core interactions, the ones users engage daily, should feel streamlined and purged of unnecessary interactions. Think about what users want to do and help them complete those tasks in the easiest and most intuitive way possible. Consider the edge cases. Everyone at all levels of experience should feel like they know how to use the product, regardless of how many features they use. Empower everyone through progressive discoverability.
- principle: Engaging
  summary: We value our users time more than our own. Involve users in the continuous quest to improve our products and keep them informed about changes. Having an overall good user experience will help users be enthusiastic and feel engaged with our products. Engaged users are willing to contribute and help us to make improvements.
- principle: Focus
  summary: Our interface should promote the conditions needed for our users to enter a state of flow. Take out friction and distractions so users can stay focused on common tasks. Our users want to stay focused, and unless it’s critical, an interruption can be frustrating. When a user reaches a flow state, even just momentarily, they will feel motivated to keep going, productive, autonomous, and empowered.
- principle: Honest
  summary: Be clear upfront about what’s happening and why. If something goes wrong, give clear recovery instructions but spare them the technical details. Be sincere and honest in the communication towards users. Celebrate achievements and be sensible about the user’s feelings and thoughts.
- principle: Minimalistic
  summary: Building something simple is anything but simple. Eliminate ambiguity. Enable users to see, understand, and act with confidence. Seek to simplify the interface by removing unnecessary elements or content that does not support user tasks. Break complex tasks into smaller steps that can be easily accomplished. Good design emphasizes the usefulness of a product whilst disregarding anything that could possibly detract from it. Everything in the interface should serve a specific purpose.
- principle: Fun & Playful
  summary: Functions must be intuitive and reliable before it can be fun for users. Delight users in surprising ways without hindering primary tasks. A carefully-placed animation, or a well-timed sound effect can be a joy to experience. Subtle effects contribute to a feeling of effortlessness and brings the interface to life.
- principle: Human
  summary: Be gentle, be human. Interfaces must respond promptly to users in a human way so that the experience feels fast and like a real conversation. Every person is different. Take into account our products are being used by various type of users with different goals and various levels of knowledge.
