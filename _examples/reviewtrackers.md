principles:
- principle: Design inclusively
  summary: Meet each person where they are and give them an equal chance in managing their customers’ experience. Design for one and extend to all; make sure things are simple by default and complex by opt-in.
- principle: Nudge towards success
  summary: Let people feel one step ahead. Favor guidance over choice and be ok with deciding for them.
- principle: Promote collaboration
  summary: More often than not, there are many people in a company using RT to achieve a shared goal. Make them feel as part of a team in the product as they are outside of it.
- principle: Embrace less is more
  summary: Remove when you are able to, replace if you can, and add if you must. When replacing or adding, be minimal.
