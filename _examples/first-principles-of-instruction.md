principles:
- principle: Task/Problem-Centered
  summary: |
    Students learn more when the instruction is centered on relevant real-world tasks or problems, including a series of tasks or problems that progress from simple to complex.
- principle: Activation
  summary: |
    Students learn more when they are directed to recall prior knowledge, to recall a structure for organizing that knowledge, or are given a structure for organizing new knowledge. This activation can also include a foundational learning experience upon which new learning can be based.
- principle: Demonstration
  summary: |
    Students learn more when new knowledge is demonstrated to them in the context of real-world tasks or problems. The knowledge that is demonstrated is both informational and skill-based. Demonstration is enhanced when it adheres to research-based principles of e-learning.
- principle: Application
  summary: |
    Students learn more when they perform real-world tasks or solve real-world problems and receive feedback and appropriate guidance during that application.
- principle: Integration
  summary: |
    Students learn more when they are encouraged to integrate their new knowledge into their life through reflection, discussion, debate, and/or presentation of new knowledge.
