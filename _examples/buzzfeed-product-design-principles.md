principles:
- principle: Delight with speed
  summary: |
    Use design to make our products feel fast and responsive. 
- principle: Keep it fresh
  summary: |
    Use bold, high-contrast designs to bring focus and clarity to key actions or information, and to represent BuzzFeed’s youthful brand.
- principle: Know the goals
  summary: |
    When designing, whether in sketches, wireframes or multiple high-fidelity options, our work should always reflect the product goals.
- principle: Consider the ecosystem
  summary: |
    Design modules and write copy with an awareness of all the places they may show up, as well as which types of BuzzFeed content they may appear with.
- principle: Design with the platform
  summary: |
    Balance native platform elements and patterns with BuzzFeed’s own design patterns and content. Our products should behave natively, while remaining uniquely BuzzFeed.
- principle: Advocate for our users 
  summary: |
    It’s our responsibility to understand our users’ needs, as well as to advocate for them with our teams and in our work.
- principle: Pair simplicity with delight
  summary: |
    Design purposeful interfaces that favor usability, while also infusing delight through color, animation and language.
- principle: Design for scale
  summary: |
    Design with an eye toward the future of our products. Value flexible, scalable designs that can quickly evolve alongside our content.
- principle: Learn, learn again 
  summary: |
    Know the data surrounding your product well enough to discuss, describe and deeply inform your design work. Constantly validate your ideas through A/B testing or qualitative analysis.
