- principle: 1. User onboarding makes or breaks your product
  summary: |
    As Julie Zhuo, the VP of Design at Facebook [says](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/design-the-beginning-b8e61081ce42): “No-one cares about the thing you have designed until they get past the beginning.” For your product to succeed, you have to successfully onboard new users, so don’t neglect this. Focus on it now and always! 
- principle: 2. It's the system of actively guiding users to new value
  summary: |
    It’s more than an email sequence or introductory modals. It’s a set of connected parts -- the goals, the cadence, the channels, the content, the framework etc. It’s about active guidance, and relevant every time there is new value to discover; not just during the first-time user experience of the overall product. 
- principle: 3. It’s not just about intuitive design
  summary: |
    A common misconception is that great or intuitive design is all you need. BJ Fogg, Professor of Persuasive Technology at Stanford University, explains in his [Behavior Model](http://www.behaviormodel.org/) that users will act when there is a combination of ability (intuitive design), motivation (strong value proposition) and triggers (prompts to action). So you have to also remember to re-emphasize the value of your product and create triggers to help users take the next step. 
- principle: 4. It’s not a set-and-forget or one-time project
  summary: |
    Scott Belsky (founder of Behance, VC at Benchmark and Chief Product Officer at Adobe) [reminds us](https://medium.com/positiveslope/crafting-the-first-mile-of-product-7ed25e8f1027) that the “first mile of the product” is the most important, but is often increasingly neglected over time. Additional complexity in the product is not handled well and new users have different expectations than the early-adopters. Your user onboarding must consistently change and get better to continue to serve your new users. 
- principle: 5. For success, designate responsibility and get buy-in
  summary: |
    To be great at user onboarding, have a person or team accountable for improvements, so that they can deliver consistent and ongoing improvements. At DocuSign and Pinterest a single team is responsible for onboarding across products and use cases, and Joe Moss (Senior Director of Growth at DocuSign) [credits this](https://www.trychameleon.com/blog/10-onboarding-lessons-from-product-experts) for their success.
- principle: 6. Know your users well
  summary: |
    Whether you prefer to use the Jobs To Be Done [framework](https://medium.com/@zbigniewgecis/8-things-to-use-in-jobs-to-be-done-framework-for-product-development-4ae7c6f3c30b) or user personas, it’s important that you know your users, beyond just the numbers. Know what they are trying to accomplish, what their motivations and hesitations are, and what their alternatives are. You can’t get this from the numbers -- you have to talk to your prospects and customers. 
- principle: 7. Identify the Aha Moments
  summary: |
    [The Aha Moment](https://www.trychameleon.com/blog/successful-user-onboarding) is a crucial concept for successful user onboarding. It’s the point at which a user internalizes (truly grasps) the value your product can provide to them. There are many smaller Aha moments, and it can vary by user and feature, but make sure to know this before designing your user onboarding. This will form the basis of your objectives. 
- principle: 8. Map the user journeys and find the friction
  summary: |
    Once you know the goals for your user onboarding, then map out in [extreme detail](https://ux.useronboard.com/product-people-mind-the-gap-da363018cc57), the key steps required for a user to reach these. This will be the user journey and you can use this to identify risks of drop-off or points of confusion. This is what you can then address with active guidance to help users reach the next step. 
- principle: 9. Any guidance should provide value 
  summary: |
    Whatever guidance you provide (emails, product tours, chat, webinars etc.) should focus on providing true value to your users, in a way they understand and appreciate. Users should find your guidance valuable in achieving their goals -- it should not feel like a chore. [Tooltips don’t have to be terrible](https://www.trychameleon.com/blog/why-tooltips-are-terrible-and-why-you-should-use-them) and you should use a [combination of channels](https://www.trychameleon.com/blog/you-need-emails-and-in-app-messages-for-user-onboarding) to achieve this. 
- principle: 10. Keep tweaking and testing
  summary: |
    There are a lot of lessons to be had when improving your user onboarding; what you learn may be counter-intuitive. For example, Airbnb found that there was no difference in engagement between users who say they know how to use the product compared to those that didn’t. Lumosity found that increasing friction in the onboarding flow created more engaged users and Yammer found that no training was as effective as their existing training. There is no single formula -- it’s an art and science unique to your users, market and product. So keep experimenting!
