principles:
- principle: #There are three fundamental elements of abstract interface design: view, content and trigger#
  summary: |
    #Astract interface elements allow us to create flexible and dynamic systems that can be adapated to any type of user interface design, whether it is touch, voice or AI#
- principle: #There are three fundamental elements of concrete interface design: page, section and action#
  summary: |
    #Concrete interface elements allow us to define how an abstract design element is to be implemented, by giving it a look & feel that is specific to a use case, context or technology#
- principle: #A view (abstract) specifies what a user can see, while a page (concrete) specifies what a user actually sees#
  summary: |
    #What a user can see is determined by things such as their roles, permissions, personas and anything that gives an overall picture of what the user's goals and needs are; a page is a snapshot in time of that overall view.#
- principle: #A content (abstract) specifies a logical unit contained within a view, while a section (concrete) specifies a logical unit contained within a page#
  summary: |
    #Contents help organize concepts and ideas within a view, just as sections help organize information and user interface elements within a page. Contents and sections can be nested within a view or page respectively.#
- principle: #A trigger (abstract) specifies a source of change to the view or content, while an action (concrete) specifies the source of change to the page or section#
  summary: |
    #Triggers help us understand the need for a view or content to vary (e.g. switching user accounts) and actions help us initiate the change (e.g. a switch account button followed by selection of account to switch to)#
