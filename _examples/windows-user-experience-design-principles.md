principles:
- principle: Reduce concepts to increase confidence
  summary: |
    * Have you introduced a new concept? Why? Is it necessary?
    * Can you get rid of unneeded concepts?
    * Are you making meaningful distinctions?
    * Does the UX continue the same concept?
- principle: Small things matter, good and bad
  summary: |
    * What are the important "small things" seen often or by many?
    * What small problems are you solving?
    * Do less better.
    * Don't cut the small things in your experiences.
    * Plan for the thoughtful details.
    * Fix the small bugs.
- principle: Be great at "look" and "do"
  summary: |
    * What is your UX great at? Does its look reflect what it is great at?
    * Does the first thing users see reflect what the UX is great at?
    * Does the UX match expectations?
    * Is it obvious what users can do?
    * Are you providing only the necessary steps?
- principle: Solve distractions, not discoverability
  summary: |
    * Reduce distractions.
    * Don't let features compete with themselves.
    * Commit to new functionality.
    * These are not solutions to poor discoverability:
      * Pinning an icon in the Start menu.
      * Putting an icon on the desktop.
      * Putting an icon in the notification area.
      * Using a notification.
      * Having a first run experience.
      * Having a tour.
- principle: UX before knobs and questions
  summary: |
    * Turn down the volume of questions.
    * Ask once.
    * Don't require configuration to get value.
    * Was the question asked already?
    * Look for opportunities to consolidate.
- principle: Personalization, not customization
  summary: |
    * Does the feature allow users to express an element of themselves?
    * Have you made the distinction between personalization and customization?
    * Does the personalization have to be a new feature, or can it make use of existing features and information (such as the user's location, background picture, or tile)?
- principle: Value the life cycle of the experience
  summary: |
    * Consider the user experience at all stages:
    * Installation and creation.
    * First use and customization.
    * Regular use.
    * Management and maintenance.
    * Uninstall or upgrade.
    * Walk through the experience as if it has been used for 12 months.
    * Does it have:
      * Realistic content.
      * Realistic volume.
- principle: Time matters, so build for people on the go
  summary: |
    * All UX principles apply equally at 12-inch and 20-inch screen sizes.
    * Be interruptible.
    * Account for starting and stopping (fast return, and do not get in the way of other UX).
    * Account for getting and losing connectivity.
    * Performance is the universal UX killer.
