principles:
- principle: MUJI is not a brand whose value rests in the frills and “extras” it adds to its products.
- principle: MUJI is simplicity – but a simplicity achieved through a complexity of thought and design.
- principle: MUJI’s streamlining is the result of the careful elimination and subtraction of gratuitous features and design unrelated to function.
- principle: MUJI, the brand, is rational, and free of agenda, doctrine, and “isms.” The MUJI concept derives from us continuously asking, “What is best from an individual’s point of view?”
- principle: MUJI aspires to modesty and plainness, the better to adapt and shape itself to the styles, preferences, and practices of as wide a group of people as possible.
- principle: MUJI – in its deliberate pursuit of the pure and the ordinary – achieves the extraordinary.
