principles:
- principle: Doherty's Threshold
  summary: Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at a pace (<400ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other.
- principle: Fitt's Law
  summary: The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.
- principle: Hick's Law
  summary: The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.
- principle: Jakob's Law
  summary: Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.
- principle: Law of Common Region
  summary: Elements tend to be perceived into groups if they are sharing an area with a clearly defined boundary.
- principle: Law of PrÃ¤gnanz
  summary: People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible, because it is the interpretation that requires the least cognitive effort of us.
- principle: Law of Proximity
  summary: Objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together.
- principle: Law of Similarity
  summary: The human eye tends to perceive similar elements in a design as a complete picture, shape, or group, even if those elements are separated.
- principle: Law of Uniform Connectedness
  summary: Elements that are visually connected are perceived as more related than elements with no connection.
- principle: Miller's Law
  summary: The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory.
- principle: Occam's Razor
  summary: Among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.
- principle: Pareto Principle
  summary: The Pareto principle states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.
- principle: Parkinson's Law
  summary: Any task will inflate until all of the available time is spent.
- principle: Peak-End Rule
  summary: People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and at its end, rather than the total sum or average of every moment of the experience.
- principle: Postel's Law
  summary: Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.
- principle: Serial Position Effect
  summary: Users have a propensity to best remember the first and last items in a series.
- principle: Tesler's Law
  summary: Tesler's Law, also known as The Law of Conservation of Complexity, states that for any system there is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced.
- principle: Von Restorff's Effect
  summary: The Von Restorff effect, also known as The Isolation Effect, predicts that when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered.
- principle: Zeigarnik Effect
  summary: People remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.
