author: Intercom
overview: Our product design principles are intended to help us make decisions when faced with competing options that seem valuable along different dimensions.

principles:
- principle: Connected, modular systems
  summary: We favor modular systems over bespoke optimizations. We reuse, evolve and merge before creating something new.
- principle: Opinionated by default, flexible under the hood
  summary: We optimize our designs to feel simple and opinionated by default, but progressively reveal power and flexibility.
- principle: Follow the fundamentals
  summary: We favor established best practices and avoid overly clever, non-standard design patterns.
- principle: Make it feel personal
  summary: Our designs reflect that weâ€™re connecting real people, not entries in a database.
- principle: What you ship is what matters
  summary: Our deliverable is not the design file. We take pride and ownership of what we ship.
