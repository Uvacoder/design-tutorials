principles:
- principle: Set the scope
  summary: We cannot cover every possible conversation. That's why we need to set our scope and make it clear from the very beginning.
- principle: Work on the personality
  summary: The personality will help your users empathize better with your chatbot. It will also limit the conversations to those related with the personality.
- principle: Create a List of Must-Have Features
  summary: What the users will expect from a chatbot with our scope? If we cannot fulfill what they need, we won't be doing anything but wasting time.
- principle: Design the Chatbot Flow
  summary: Think about it as all the ways a user will try to get from a starting point to your end goal.
