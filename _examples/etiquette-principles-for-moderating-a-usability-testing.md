principles:
- principle: Be gentle
  summary: |
    Welcome the participants, introduce yourself, ask for confirmation of their name and thank them for their participation.
- principle: Break the ice
  summary: |
    Explain the testing methodology, specify that you’re not going to test the participants but you’re conducting a research to evaluate the product. Start with a short interview to understand your interlocutors habits and their familiarity with the product or service being tested.
- principle: Avoid unexpected events and distractions
  summary: |
    Check the prototype and the test manual with a smaller sample of users before starting the test campaign. Ask to silence notifications before starting the testing session.
- principle: Be honest
  summary: |
    Inform the tester about the recording and request consent to proceed.
- principle: Avoid bias
  summary: |
    Do not test your own product, let other researchers do it. Do not recruit people who are too experienced in testing. Do not recruit people who already had experience with the same product.
- principle: Encourage criticism
  summary: |
    Declare that you are not the designer of the product. Require maximum openness and sincerity from the user. Do not assume a position of superiority over the interlocutor and don’t blame him for being inexperienced. Don't crowd the session with unnecessary observers.
- principle: Do not influence the tester
  summary: |
    Be as invisible as possible, do not suggest actions. Don't judge the tester preferences and opinions. Avoid telling your own experience or opinion, unless needed to put the tester at ease and make him better understand the task to be carried out.
- principle: Don't require an excessive effort
  summary: |
    Propose one task at a time. Do not exceed the timing and the number of use cases.
- principle: Learn more
  summary: |
    Observe first, then ask why. You must distinguish usability problems from user bias.
