title: Asana's Design Principles
author: Asana
overview: Design Principles should help the product team remain focused on a consistent vision of what makes our product experience unique. They should be specific enough to differentiate us from other products, reflect our values, and help us make decisions; but be broad enough to apply universally to our product.

principles:
 - principle: Allow users to focus on their work without interference.
   summary: A user’s focus should be in their control, only distract users with changes that are personally relevant.
 - principle: Increase confidence through clarity.
   summary: Within the application, and more broadly within teams, it is unambiguous what is happening and why.
 - principle: Foster productive and emotionally satisfying interpersonal dynamics.
   summary: Users feel like they are part of a team, where they can count on each other to do their part, and feel like they’re moving forward towards a common goal.
 - principle: Design for fast, effortless, and intentional interactions.
   summary: Simple and common tasks should be frictionless and obvious; complex tasks should feel efficient and delightful. But, speed should not lead to inaccuracies.
 - principle: Empower everyone through progressive discoverability.
   summary: Everyone at all levels of experience with Asana should feel like they know how to use the product, regardless of how many features they use.
 - principle: Be consistent and standard, and innovate when it’s worth it.
   summary: Users should feel like Asana is familiar, yet modern.
