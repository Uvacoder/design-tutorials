title: Ad Victorem I.D.E.A. Design Process
author: Ad Victorem
overview: Ad Victorem is a strategy and design agency that puts ideas first, because without concepts and creativity, marketing is just noise. The following phases outline how we create the “big idea” of any marketing campaign combining strategy, creativity and execution. And it's not just about technical precision. It also involves emotional impact — the very human factors that can't be measured on a spreadsheet.

principles:
- principle: INSPIRATION
  summary: Big ideas are multidimensional, so we draw from multiple sources of inspiration: business goals, challenges and pain points. 
- principle: DESIGN
  summary: Big ideas go beyond artwork to shape all brand elements, from the message to the media. We base every design decision on a purpose and we make you stand out from the crowd by doing better than "best practices”.
- principle: EXECUTION
  summary: Big ideas include deployment and management. Never design and run. Instead, we pay attention to the details and iterate as the market shifts.
- principle: ANALYSIS
  summary: Big ideas must perform, we utilize “real metrics” to ensure goals are met. Such as; Is the idea enhancing and differentiating the brand? Is the idea generating buzz? Is the idea motivating desired behavior from the target audience?
