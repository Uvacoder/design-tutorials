title: 7 Principles for Designing Appropriate Technologies
author: Clement Colin & Antoine Martin
overview: The seven design principles are aimed at arbitrating the level of machinal intensity to be proposed as well as improving the user experience of appropriate technologies (a.k.a. “low-techs”). Appropriate technologies are an interesting alternative when looking for technical solutions that can have a reduced impact on the environment as well as a positive impact on human well-being. Yet, appropriate technologies tend to be user-intensive and suffer from a makeshift appearance, which generates user problems. The seven design principles can guide you toward possible solutions. You can use them to guide you when designing appropriate technologies but also as a way to reflect on your day-to-day practice within the mainstream user experience paradigm (for example, during reflective practice workshops).

principles:
- principle: Needs and Satisfiers Negotiation
  summary: |
    Needs and Satisfiers Negotiation is a process encompassing the participative identification, prioritization and dimensioning of the situated needs and satisfiers that the low-tech artefact must meet in order to define the appropriate functionalities.
- principle: Autonomy-Assistance Arbitration
  summary: |
    Autonomy-Assistance Arbitration refers to the identification of the tasks that should be handled by the artefact/service and those that should be handled by users. This is done using potential human/environmental harms (e.g., dependency) and benefits (e.g., empowerment) as well as relative capacities of human/artefact as arbitration criteria.
- principle: Non-Functional Aspects
  summary: |
    Non-Functional Aspects are cultural, legal and aesthetic features that are important for the experience of the low-tech artefact without playing a direct functional role in the artefact’s operations.
- principle: Discoverability
  summary: |
    Discoverability is the easiness with which lowtechs’ users can identify interaction possibilities and the current state of the device.
- principle: Operative Transparency
  summary: |
    Operative Transparency is the degree of accessibility for users to the knowledge, procedures and models underlying the artefact’s operation. It minimizes the distance that the artefact places between users and reality and enable them to efficiently monitor the operation of the low-tech artefact.
- principle: Information, Education and Training
  summary: |
    Information, Education and Training is the development of user skills and knowledge related to the production, installation, and use of low-tech artefacts. It enables the use of low-techs by different users’ skill profiles and the improvement of their technological literacy.
- principle: Compensation
  summary: |
    Compensation is the process that counterbalances the new material flows that the low-tech artefact requires or generates to be usable compared to an alternative of higher machinal intensity.
