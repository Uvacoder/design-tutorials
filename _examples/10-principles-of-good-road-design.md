title: 10 Principles of Good Road Design
author: Highways England Strategic Design Panel
overview: |
    Design vision "We aim to put people at the heart of our work by designing an inclusive, resilient and sustainable road network; admired for its functional elegance and usefulness, reflecting in its design the beauty of the natural and built environment through which it passes, and enhancing it where possible."

principles:
- principle: makes roads safe and useful
summary: Safety is fundamental to good road design; it is integral to both the usefulness of its function and the positive experience for the road user. Safe roads should support and link to wider economic, environmental and social imperatives, both nationally and locally. And good roads are fundamentally useful, meeting the usersâ€™ need for mobility effectively.
- principle: is inclusive
summary: Inclusive environments facilitate dignified and equal use by all and are the result of an inter-disciplinary design process which places people and their needs at its heart. This means including people, communities and businesses early and in every stage of the design process, in a manner that reduces barriers to access and participation and which considers these needs both in design and ongoing use. This should ensure that all users are considered, with a focus on the most vulnerable.
- principle: makes roads understandable
summary: Design must make usage of the road intuitive and avoid unnecessary and confusing clutter. Good road design demonstrates sensitivity to the landscape, heritage and local stories of the places that it affects, whilst being clear about its function. 
- principle: fits in context
summary: Roads constitute a key infrastructure legacy, so it is essential that their design responds to the places through which they pass. Good road design makes an important contribution to the conservation and enhancement of the natural and cultural environment. It seeks to enhance those places, whilst being honest about structural necessities.
- principle: is restrained
summary: Good road design should be functional responding positively and even elegantly to its natural and cultural setting, allowing the identity of the places through which they pass to come through. 
- principle: is thorough
summary: Good road design is the result of robust design processes that create a continuous cycle of improvement, which is open to learning from best practice across the world. Nothing must be arbitrary or left to chance. Care and accuracy in the design process shows respect towards the road users and the people and communities that live with road infrastructure. 
- principle: is environmentally sustainable
summary: It seeks to design for net environmental gain at the earliest stage and wherever possible. It is resilient and sustainable, demonstrating an awareness of the need to allow for future adaptation and technical requirements using materials sustainably and contributing to the circular economy. 
- principle: is innovative
summary: Technological development is always offering new opportunities for innovative design. Good road design will always be responsive to change and capture opportunities for betterment and should develop in tandem with innovative technology.
- principle: is long-lasting
summary: Good road design lasts many years. The process of good design also requires sufficient time for challenges to be resolved before delivery and should anticipate adaptation to future needs and technologies as part of the commitment to whole-life operation, management and maintenance. 
- principle: is a collaborative process
summary: Good design practice is central to developing a smoother, smarter, more sustainable road network that is useful to and accepted by the society it serves. This is established through a rigorous evidence based project development framework that recognises dependencies and facilitates opportunities for collaboration, whilst concentrating on the benefits and enhancements that road building seeks to deliver.
