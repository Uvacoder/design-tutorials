principles:
- principle: Compatibility
  summary: |
    Address the necessity of supporting existing HTML content, design HTML 5 document requirements so that Web content can degrade gradually; and specify, adopt and adapt existing technology where possible.
- principle: Utility
  summary: |
    The principles of utility call for design that ensures features can be used effectively, and for all intended purposes.
- principle: Interoperability
  summary: |
    Interoperable HTML 5 implementation means defining behaviors in preference to vague or implementation-define behavior, avoiding needless complexity, and handling errors gracefully as opposed to hard failure.
- principle: Universal access
  summary: |
    Features should be designed for universal access - to work across as many platforms as possible, support all world languages and scripts, and to be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
