title: Principles of Calm Technology
author: Amber Case
overview: |
    Our world is made of information that competes for our attention.
    What is necessary? What is not?

    When we design products, we aim to choose the best position for user interface components, placing the most important ones in the most accessible places on the screen.

    Equally important is the design of communication. How many notifications are necessary? How and when should they be displayed? To answer this, we can be inspired by the principles of calm technology.
