title: 8 Design Principles for Shared Physical Artefacts
author: Clement Colin
overview: The “shareability principles” are a set of eight design principles aimed at defining and operationalising sharing activities. They are specific to shared physical artefacts (e.g., cars, tools). They have been synthesized from elements extracted from reports and scientific papers. They have been tested experimentally regarding their reliability/effectiveness and improved accordingly. The linked document also provides subprinciples and extended definitions.
