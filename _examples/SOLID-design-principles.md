principles:
- principle: Single Responsibility Principle
  summary: A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.
- principle: Open Closed Principle
  summary: Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- principle: Liskov substitution principle
  summary: Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
- principle: Interface Segregation Principle
  summary: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
- principle: Dependency Inversion Principle
  summary: One should depend upon abstractions, rather than concrete implementations.
