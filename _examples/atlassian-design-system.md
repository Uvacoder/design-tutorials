title: Atlassian Design System – Values and Principles
author: Atlassian Design System, Atlassian
overview-author: @jenniesyip
overview: | 
  We use the Atlassian Design System values and principles to align our team around a clear set of shared beliefs and goals. They embody our team ethos and will evolve as the design system changes and scales over time.
  Values are our fundamental beliefs (what we hold true), and principles exist to guide our behavior (how we achieve those values).

principles:
- principle: Foundational (Value)
  summary: |
    We solve the common problems for all, small and large, to provide a solid foundation that consumers can confidently build upon. We avoid consistency for the sake of consistency and reject infinite flexibility.
- principle: Trusted fundamentals before comprehensive patterns
  summary: |
    We solve common foundational problems, enabling consumers to focus on their product experiences.
    We provide opinionated building blocks, which allow consumers to compose more complex, bespoke experiences. We don’t support unlimited flexibility but offer a robust foundation for consumers to build upon.
    We ensure quality through research and clear standards (accessibility, responsiveness, reusability) — otherwise, it can’t exist in the system. (Build with heart and balance).
    We consider scale, starting with enterprise-level platform needs.
- principle: Harmonious (Value)
  summary: |
    Our building blocks work together to create a suite of products that feel familiar, cohesive, and part of a family. We strive to gain trust through intent and purpose.
- principle: Meeting system needs before delivering features
  summary: |
    We bring in all perspectives to co-create and shape our design language.
    We finish what we start, especially before starting something new — a limited, but complete, cross-functional experience is better than the sum of many incomplete, single-function solutions.
    We are informed by continuous feedback. (Don’t #@!% the customer).
    We don’t stop at shipping — documentation, support, deprecation, and maintenance should always be considered for the best consumer experience.
- principle: Empowering, for everyone (Value)
  summary: |
    We strive to make our design system work for everyone who relies on it, regardless of discipline, skill level, or tenure. By enabling as many people as possible to use the system, we multiply our impact.
- principle: Bringing people on the journey before helping for the moment
  summary: |
    We bring consumers into our process to educate, build trust, and create a sense of shared ownership.
    We prioritize the best service experience. We take the time to provide consumers the right amount of resources, support, and context. (Open company, no bullshit).
    We optimize for self-service through our tools and information. We want consumers to independently make decisions with confidence.
    We want consumers to become champions — we inspire them to improve their craft — and in turn, we improve ours too.
