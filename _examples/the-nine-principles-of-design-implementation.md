It can be used as a guide for someone working on implementation or as a tool to evaluate an existing project. So, whether youâ€™re reviewing code, auditing CSS or interviewing candidates for a role on your team, these principles should provide a structure that transcends specific techniques and results in a common approach to implementing design.
