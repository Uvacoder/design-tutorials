principles:
- principle: Useful is forever
  summary: Bells and whistles wear off, but usefulness never does. We build useful software that does just what you need and nothing you don’t.
- principle: Great service is everything
  summary: We’re famous for fast and friendly customer service. We work hard to make sure we live up to that reputation every day.
- principle: Clarity is king
  summary: Buzzwords, lingo, and sensationalized sales-and-marketing-speak have no place at 37signals. We communicate clearly and honestly.
- principle: Our customers are our investors
  summary: Our customers fund our daily operations by paying for our products. We answer to them — not investors, the stock market, or a board of directors.
- principle: The basics are beautiful
  summary: |
    We’ll never overlook what really matters: The basics. Great service, ease of use, honest pricing, and respect for our customer’s time, money, and trust.
- principle: No hidden fees or secret prices
  summary: We believe everyone is entitled to the best price we can offer. Our prices are public, published right on our site, and the same no matter who you are.
- principle: Software should be easy
  summary: Our products are intuitive. You’ll pick them up in seconds or minutes, not hours, days or weeks. We don’t sell you training because you don’t need it.
- principle: Long-term contracts are obscene
  summary: No one likes being locked into something they don’t want anymore. Our customers can cancel at any time, no questions asked. No setup/termination fees either.
