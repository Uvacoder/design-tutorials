principles:
- principle: Design with empathy
  summary: |
    Understand our customers and end users better than they understand themselves.
- principle: A Seek interaction is transparent, honest and trustworthy
  summary: |
    A user experience at Seek should be true to the brand & true to how people want to be treated. “If we want users to like our software, we should design it to behave like a likeable person.” – Alan Cooper
- principle: Use persuasive design to achieve business goals
  summary: |
    It is not enough that our design is usable, it should be used in a way that encourages users towards the goals of SEEK. A registered user action is more valuable than an anonymous one, a searchable profile is more useful than a hidden one.
- principle: Content is king
  summary: |
    A person’s focus should be on their content, not on the UI. Help people work without interference.
- principle: Simplicity is powerful
  summary: |
    A minimalist form and function keeps users focused on their goals without distraction. It improves on-screen responsiveness as well as being suited to small-screen implementations.
- principle: Data informs design
  summary: |
    “One accurate measurement is worth more than a thousand expert opinions.” – Grace Hopper
- principle: Consistency matters
  summary: |
    Appearance follows behaviour (Form follows function). Designed elements should look like they behave—someone should be able to predict how an interface element will behave merely by looking at it. Embrace consistency, but not homogeneity. If something looks the same it should always act the same.
- principle: Accessible design is good design
  summary: |
    In principle Seek design should be usable on all devices by all of the people in all situations. Design is simple, touch friendly and clear and aims for AA accessibility.
- principle: Make it mine
  summary: |
    The jobseeking experience is highly personal one that takes place over extended periods of time. The experience should align to the way that users conduct their jobseeking, allowing them to continue where they left off.
- principle: Don’t make users think
  summary: |
    Observation shows that users do not read instructions. Interactions should be task focused, eliminating decision points and generally use one clear call to action.
