title: The 10,000 Year Clock
author: Danny Hillis
overview: |
    These are the principles that Danny Hillis used in the initial stages of designing a 10,000 Year Clock. We have found these are generally good principles for designing anything to last a long time.

principles:
- principle: Longevity
  summary: |
    With occasional maintenance, the clock should reasonably be expected to display the correct time for the next 10,000 years.
- principle: Maintainability
  summary: |
    The clock should be maintainable with bronze-age technology.
- principle: Transparency
  summary: |
    It should be possible to determine operational principles of the clock by close inspection.
- principle: Evolvability
  summary: |
    It should be possible to improve the clock with time.
- principle: Scalability
  summary: |
    It should be possible to build working models of the clock from table-top to monumental size using the same design.
